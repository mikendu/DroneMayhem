### Some Notes

- Ignore the virtual env in this directory, this software runs using Windows installation of python, at 
C:/Users/Michael/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe, which has its own venv. 
- Related to the above, the `cflib` module in this directory can also be ignored, any changes will not affect the running code.
- To edit the `cflib` module, edit the one in the site packages in the Windows python path. Run `setup` to find the location of this path.
- Even though this uses Windows python, the `setup` and `run` scripts must be run from a bash (Cygwin) terminal.
